# Clima ‚òÅ

A weather app I coded using Flutter/Dart and based off starter code from [Angela Yu's (in collaboration with the Google Flutter team) Flutter course](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/).
You'll be able to check your current location's weather conditions along with any city you can think of!

Inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-).
